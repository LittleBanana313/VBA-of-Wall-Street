Moderate Solution:
  - Applies relevant headers
  - Collects unique tickers and lists them in column I
  - Finds the change in price for each unique ticker in a given year and lists in column J
  - Finds % change in price for each unique ticker and lists in column K
  - Finds total stock volume per unique ticker and pastes in column L

Challenge Solution
  - Utilizes headers applied in the Moderate solution
  - Utilizes the same loop used in Moderate solution to: 

    - Finds Max and Min % change & records associated tickers
    - Finds Max total volume & records associated ticker
