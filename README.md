Struggles and Successes
Final Code includes moderate and challenge solution that runs through all sheets in the file with one fell swoop.

Pictures of 2014, 2015, 2016 included for edification.

See Source folder for old versions of code throughout development.


Moderate Solution:
  - Applies relevant headers
  - Collects unique tickers and lists them in column I
  - Finds the change in price for each unique ticker in a given year and lists in column J
  - Finds % change in price for each unique ticker and lists in column K
  - Finds total stock volume per unique ticker and pastes in column L

Challenge Solution
  - Utilizes headers applied in the Moderate solution
  - Utilizes the same loop used in Moderate solution to: 

    - Finds Max and Min % change & records associated ticker
    - Finds Max total volume & records associated ticker
